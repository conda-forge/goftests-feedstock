  summary: 'Goodness of fit tests for general datatypes'
  description: |
    Goftests is intended for unit testing random samplers that generate
    arbitrary plain-old-data, and focuses on robustness rather than
    statistical efficiency. In contrast to scipy.stats and statsmodels,
    goftests does not make assumptions on the distribution being
    tested, and requires only a simple (sample, prob) interface
    provided by MCMC samplers.
